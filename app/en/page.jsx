            Frequently Asked Questions
          </h3>

          <h4 className="text-[18px] font-semibold">
            1. Is it legal to download Facebook videos?
          </h4>

          <p className="mb-3">
            Downloading Facebook videos may violate Facebook’s terms of service,
            as the platform generally discourages downloading content without
            permission. However, it can be legal if you have the right
            permissions or if the video is publicly available. Always ensure you
            have the right to download and use the content according to local
            laws and Facebook’s policies.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-[18px] font-semibold">
            2. Do I need to create an account to download videos?
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Most Facebook video downloader websites do not require you to create
            an account. You can typically download videos by simply pasting the
            video URL into the provided field on the website and following the
            download instructions.
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-[18px] font-semibold">
            3. Can I download videos in different formats and resolutions?
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Yes, many Facebook video downloader websites offer options to
            download videos in various formats (e.g., MP4, AVI) and resolutions
            (e.g., 360p, 720p, 1080p). After pasting the video URL, you can
            usually choose your preferred format and resolution before
            downloading.
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-[18px] font-semibold">
            4. Are there any limitations on the number of videos I can download?
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-3">
            While many free Facebook video downloader websites allow unlimited
            downloads, some might have limitations on the number of videos you
            can download per day or restrict certain features to premium users.
            Always check the website's usage policy or FAQs for specific
            limitations.
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-[18px] font-semibold">
            5. Is it safe to use Facebook video downloader websites?
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Safety can vary depending on the website. Reputable video downloader
            websites are generally safe to use, but some might contain ads,
            pop-ups, or potentially malicious content. To ensure safety, use
            well-known and trusted sites, avoid downloading executable files,
            and have good antivirus software installed on your device. Always
            read user reviews and ratings if available.
